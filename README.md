# Daily Planner App

Project Team: Alexis Wu, Catherine Jin, Smriti Somasundaram

Project Mentor: Spencer Grossarth

## Product Overview

While many planner apps already exist on the market, many present critical problems for users â€” many are far too complicated for quick, daily planning, and "simpler" apps are stripped of many features essential to good planning. 

With efficient, easy-to-use features and a clean user interface, Planni5 solves those problems. Designed to only take 5 minutes of your day, Planni5 offers easy-access to tasks via both a calendar and a to-do list. A simple log-in and sign-up page saves the user's task history, and event notifications keep users productive and on-track of their daily schedules.
